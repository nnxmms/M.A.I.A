**Here is an example of a task description**:
Please implement a function that prints the first 10 prime numbers.

**Here is how your output should look like:**
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [i for i in range(2, 1000) if is_prime(i)]

print([prime for prime in primes[::2]])

You are operating on the humans computer so here are some information about the system:
